# Memra Installation Guide for Newbies

This guide will walk you through installing Memra and running the ETL workflow on a completely fresh machine. We'll cover everything from basic prerequisites to running the demo.

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- âœ… Memra SDK installed and working
- âœ… PostgreSQL database running
- âœ… MCP bridge server running
- âœ… ETL workflow processing PDF invoices
- âœ… Data stored in PostgreSQL database

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- **Operating System**: macOS, Linux, or Windows (WSL recommended for Windows)
- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **Memory**: At least 4GB RAM
- **Storage**: At least 2GB free space
- **Internet**: Required for downloading packages and models

### Required Software
1. **Python 3.8+** - [Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. **Git** - [Download here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3. **Docker** - [Download here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
4. **PostgreSQL** (we'll use Docker for this)

## ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Installation

### Step 1: Verify Prerequisites

First, let's make sure you have the required software:

```bash
# Check Python version (should be 3.8 or higher)
python3 --version

# Check Git
git --version

# Check Docker
docker --version

# Check if Docker is running
docker ps
```

**If any of these fail:**
- Install the missing software from the links above
- For Docker, make sure Docker Desktop is running

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the Memra repository
git clone https://github.com/memra-platform/memra-sdk.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd memra-sdk

# Verify you're in the right place
ls -la
```

You should see files like `README.md`, `setup.py`, `memra/`, etc.

### Step 3: Install Memra SDK

```bash
# Install Memra from PyPI (recommended for most users)
pip install memra

# OR install in development mode (if you want to modify the code)
pip install -e .
```

**Verify installation:**
```bash
# Check if Memra is installed
python3 -c "import memra; print('Memra installed successfully!')"
```

### Step 4: Set Up PostgreSQL Database

We'll use Docker to run PostgreSQL:

```bash
# Create a Docker network for our services
docker network create memra-network

# Start PostgreSQL container
docker run -d \
  --name memra-postgres \
  --network memra-network \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=memra_invoice_db \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=memra \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=memra123 \
  -p 5433:5432 \
  postgres:15

# Wait a moment for PostgreSQL to start
sleep 5

# Verify PostgreSQL is running
docker ps | grep memra-postgres
```

### Step 5: Set Up the Database Schema

```bash
# Install PostgreSQL client tools
# On macOS: brew install postgresql
# On Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install postgresql-client
# On Windows: Use the PostgreSQL installer

# Create the database schema
psql -h localhost -p 5433 -U memra -d memra_invoice_db -c "
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS invoices (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    invoice_number VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    vendor_name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    invoice_date DATE NOT NULL,
    due_date DATE,
    total_amount NUMERIC NOT NULL,
    tax_amount NUMERIC,
    line_items JSONB,
    status VARCHAR NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    raw_json JSONB
);

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW invoice_flat_view AS
SELECT
    id,
    raw_json->'billingDetails'->>'invoiceNumber' AS invoice_number,
    raw_json->'headerSection'->>'vendorName' AS vendor_name,
    CASE 
        WHEN raw_json->'billingDetails'->>'invoiceDate' = '' THEN NULL
        ELSE (raw_json->'billingDetails'->>'invoiceDate')::date 
    END AS invoice_date,
    CASE 
        WHEN raw_json->'billingDetails'->>'dueDate' = '' THEN NULL
        ELSE (raw_json->'billingDetails'->>'dueDate')::date 
    END AS due_date,
    (raw_json->'chargesSummary'->>'document_total')::numeric AS total_amount,
    (raw_json->'chargesSummary'->>'secondary_tax')::numeric AS tax_amount,
    raw_json->'chargesSummary'->'lineItemsBreakdown' AS line_items,
    raw_json->>'status' AS status,
    created_at,
    updated_at
FROM invoices;
"
```

### Step 6: Install Additional Dependencies

```bash
# Install required Python packages
pip install psycopg2-binary aiohttp aiohttp-cors httpx prettytable

# Install build tools (for development)
pip install build twine
```

### Step 7: Set Up Environment Variables

```bash
# Set the Memra API key (development key)
export MEMRA_API_KEY="test-secret-for-development"

# Set database connection
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://memra:memra123@localhost:5433/memra_invoice_db"

# Add to your shell profile (optional, for persistence)
echo 'export MEMRA_API_KEY="test-secret-for-development"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://memra:memra123@localhost:5433/memra_invoice_db"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

### Step 8: Start the MCP Bridge Server

The MCP bridge server provides tools for the ETL workflow:

```bash
# Navigate to the memra-ops directory
cd memra-ops

# Start the MCP bridge server
python3 mcp_bridge_server.py &

# Wait for the server to start
sleep 3

# Verify the server is running
curl -s http://localhost:8081/health
```

You should see a response indicating the server is healthy.

### Step 9: Download Sample Invoice Data

```bash
# Navigate back to the main directory
cd ..

# Create the data directory
mkdir -p demos/etl_invoice_processing/data/invoices

# Download sample invoice PDFs (you'll need to provide your own PDF files)
# For testing, you can use any PDF invoice files you have
# Place them in: demos/etl_invoice_processing/data/invoices/

# Example: Copy existing PDF files if you have them
# cp /path/to/your/invoices/*.pdf demos/etl_invoice_processing/data/invoices/
```

**Note**: You'll need to provide your own PDF invoice files for testing. Any PDF invoice will work.

### Step 10: Run the ETL Workflow

```bash
# Navigate to the ETL demo directory
cd demos/etl_invoice_processing

# Run the ETL workflow
python3 etl_invoice_demo.py
```

**What happens during execution:**
1. The script will scan for PDF files in the `data/invoices/` directory
2. For each PDF, it will:
   - Extract data using vision models
   - Validate the extracted data
   - Store the data in PostgreSQL
   - Show progress and results

**Interactive prompts:**
- When prompted, type `Y` to process each invoice
- Or type `B` to process all remaining invoices in batch mode

### Step 11: Verify the Results

```bash
# Check the database for processed invoices
psql -h localhost -p 5433 -U memra -d memra_invoice_db -c "
SELECT 
    id,
    invoice_number,
    vendor_name,
    invoice_date,
    total_amount,
    status,
    created_at
FROM invoice_flat_view
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
"

# Check the raw JSON data
psql -h localhost -p 5433 -U memra -d memra_invoice_db -c "
SELECT 
    id,
    raw_json->'billingDetails'->>'invoiceNumber' as invoice_number,
    raw_json->'headerSection'->>'vendorName' as vendor_name
FROM invoices
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
"
```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. PostgreSQL Connection Issues
```bash
# Check if PostgreSQL is running
docker ps | grep memra-postgres

# If not running, restart it
docker start memra-postgres

# Check logs
docker logs memra-postgres
```

#### 2. MCP Bridge Server Issues
```bash
# Check if the server is running
curl -s http://localhost:8081/health

# If not running, restart it
cd memra-ops
python3 mcp_bridge_server.py &
```

#### 3. Python Import Errors
```bash
# Reinstall Memra
pip uninstall memra
pip install memra

# Check Python path
python3 -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"
```

#### 4. Permission Issues
```bash
# On Linux/macOS, you might need to use sudo for some commands
sudo docker run ...
sudo pip install ...
```

#### 5. Port Conflicts
If port 5433 or 8081 is already in use:
```bash
# Find what's using the port
lsof -i :5433
lsof -i :8081

# Kill the process or use different ports
```

## ðŸ“Š Understanding the Results

### What the ETL Workflow Does

1. **PDF Processing**: Uses vision models to extract text and data from PDF invoices
2. **Data Extraction**: Identifies invoice numbers, vendor names, amounts, dates, etc.
3. **Validation**: Checks if the extracted data is complete and valid
4. **Database Storage**: Stores both structured data and raw JSON in PostgreSQL
5. **Monitoring**: Provides real-time feedback on the processing status

### Database Tables

- **`invoices`**: Main table with all invoice data
- **`invoice_flat_view`**: View for easy querying of structured data

### Sample Queries

```sql
-- View all processed invoices
SELECT * FROM invoice_flat_view ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Find invoices by vendor
SELECT * FROM invoice_flat_view WHERE vendor_name LIKE '%Propane%';

-- Check processing status
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM invoice_flat_view GROUP BY status;

-- View raw JSON data
SELECT raw_json FROM invoices WHERE id = 1;
```

## ðŸ§¹ Cleanup

When you're done testing:

```bash
# Stop the MCP bridge server
pkill -f mcp_bridge_server.py

# Stop and remove PostgreSQL container
docker stop memra-postgres
docker rm memra-postgres

# Remove the Docker network
docker network rm memra-network

# Uninstall Memra (optional)
pip uninstall memra
```
