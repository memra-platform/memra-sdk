# Repository Separation Summary

## Overview

The Memra codebase has been successfully separated into three distinct repositories to improve security, maintainability, and development workflow.

## Repository Structure

### 1. memra-sdk (Public Repository - Current)
**Purpose**: Clean SDK for developers to build workflows
**Location**: This repository
**Contents**:
- `memra/` - Core SDK package
- `examples/` - Example workflows and use cases
- `docs/` - Documentation
- `tests/` - Test suite
- `local/dependencies/` - Local development setup
- `scripts/` - Utility scripts

**What was removed**:
- `logic/` directory (moved to memra-workflows)
- `app.py`, `server_tool_registry.py` (moved to memra-ops)
- Server deployment files: `fly.toml`, `Dockerfile`, `Procfile`, etc. (moved to memra-ops)
- `mcp_bridge_server.py` (moved to memra-workflows)

### 2. memra-workflows (Private Repository)
**Purpose**: Business logic and workflow implementations
**Location**: `../memra-workflows-backup/` (ready for private repo creation)
**Contents**:
- `logic/` directory with all tool implementations
- `mcp_bridge_server.py` for local tool execution
- Business-specific workflow logic

### 3. memra-ops (Private Repository)
**Purpose**: Infrastructure, deployment, and server operations
**Location**: `../memra-ops-backup/` (ready for private repo creation)
**Contents**:
- `app.py` - Main Flask server
- `server_tool_registry.py` - Server-side tool registry
- `config.py` - Configuration management
- Deployment files: `fly.toml`, `Dockerfile`, `Procfile`, `docker-compose.yml`
- `requirements.txt` - Server dependencies

## Architecture Benefits

### Security
- Business logic is now private and not exposed in the public SDK
- Server infrastructure code is separated from client code
- API keys and sensitive configuration are isolated

### Development Workflow
- SDK developers can work on the public repository without access to proprietary logic
- Business logic developers can iterate on workflows without affecting SDK stability
- Infrastructure changes are isolated from application logic

### Deployment
- SDK can be published to PyPI independently
- Server deployments don't require SDK changes
- Business logic updates don't require infrastructure changes

## Current Status

âœ… **Completed**:
- Repository separation and file organization
- Backup directories created with all necessary files
- SDK repository cleaned and updated
- README and documentation updated
- Package structure verified

ðŸ”„ **Next Steps**:
1. Create private GitHub repositories for memra-workflows and memra-ops
2. Initialize git repositories in backup directories
3. Push to private repositories
4. Update CI/CD pipelines for each repository
5. Set up proper access controls

## File Locations

### Backed Up Files
- **Workflows**: `../memra-workflows-backup/`
- **Operations**: `../memra-ops-backup/`

### Current Repository (SDK)
- Clean SDK-only structure
- Ready for public development
- Version 0.2.1 published to PyPI

## Testing

The architecture separation has been tested and verified:
- SDK imports work without logic dependencies
- Tool registry properly routes between server and MCP
- Real workflow execution confirmed working
- Package distribution excludes server files

## API Keys

No API keys were invalidated during this process:
- Server: `MEMRA_API_KEYS="memra-prod-2024-001"` (on Fly.io)
- Client: `MEMRA_API_KEY="memra-prod-2024-001"` (for users)
